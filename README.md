# Real-World Python Deep Learning Projects [Video]
This is the code repository for [Real-World Python Deep Learning Projects [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/real-world-python-deep-learning-projects-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788620161), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Deep learning allows you to solve problems where traditional Machine Learning methods might have poor performance.Detecting and extracting objects from images, extracting meaning from text and predicting outcomes based on complex dependencies to name a few. In this course you will learn how to use deep learning in practice by going through real-world examples.
You will start of by creating neural networks to predict the demand for airline travel in the future. Then, you would run through a scenario where you have to identifying negative tweets for a celebrity by using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN’s). Next we will create a neural network which will be able to identify smiles in your camera app. Finally, the last project will help you forecast the stock prices of a company for the next day using deep learning.   
By the end of this course you will get a solid understanding of deep learning and the ability to build your own deep learning models.
